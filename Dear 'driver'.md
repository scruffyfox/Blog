I received a letter on the windshield of my car after a long hard days work today which kinda made me chuckle a little. Let me give you some context firstly.

I work in an office building and there's no parking. So I have to park in a back road in Westbourne (where as you may know, its notorious for finding parking). This road is quite long and has no double yellow lines. On one side is a rail track and the other is residential estates. Now This morning was bad as it was pissing down with rain. And that's an understatement. I found a nice small space and parked there.

Then I received this letter.

I'll transcribe

```
Dear 'Driver',

At [removed] Road, we have seen our fair share of poor parking over the years. All previous encounters pale in comparison to your effort this morning. You have made it impossible for emergency services to access our property + a number of cars have been forced to park further up [removed] road.

I would you calling me tomorrow to explain your parking intentions. If I don't hear from you by 10.30am, I shall, as advised by the council, forward the details of your car to the police.

I don't want to assume you are lazy & selfish so feel it only fair that you are given the opportunity to explain your parking.

Many Thanks,
[removed]

Now I'll admit, my parking wasn't amazing and I do apologise, but let me put into context the several issues with this letter.

1) The estate has TWO entrances as depicted in my diagram below.

Now the car in front of me had around 4-5ft of space in front of him before the first entrance. My back wheel (green) was overlapping the dropped kerb.

2) **NO** emergency services (in the UK) would park on a drive in the event of an emergency (unless the house is a mansion has has like a 300yard driveway), They would park on the road.

3) I was not in any wrong. I was not completely blocking the driveway, even if I was, YOU HAVE TWO!

4) There's no double yellow lines.

I'm sorry but threatening me with the police would not do you any favours. I know I parked like an idiot and I won't do it again, that's all you really had to say.

You can call the police all you want, but; I have valid insurance, road tax, MOT + Service. You don't really have anything on me.
