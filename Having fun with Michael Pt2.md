It's been about 10 months since my last encounter with any recruitment agents, and to my surprise the other day, I received an email. I noticed in the email footer the signature, and it turns out that its the same company as the last email I received when I decided to have a [little fun](havingfunwithmichael.md).

What's weird is that I took a look through their website, and I recognised one of their team members' name on there, so I did a quick search in my email history, just over a year ago, I actually got another email from the same company, so so far that's 3 emails from different people of the **same** company. Hopefully by now i'm on their 'do not contact' list.

As per all unsolicited emails, I decided to yet again, have a little fun.

>Though I realize you may not be actively looking for new opportunities, I would be keen to see what it would take for you to consider a new position, specifically within London. I am currently working with Badoo, the social media network; Hailo, the taxi cab start-up and Blinkbox, the video on demand platform, expanding each of their development teams, with a specific focus on mobile engineering.

>If you would be open to an informal, exploratory chat, I’d be keen to learn more about you and what motivates you and also more information regarding the specific roles. Knowing what your motivations and interests are will help me match your profile to the most relevant roles when they arise. If this just isn't the right timing for you, let me know and hopefully we can keep in touch for the future.

>Hi Alfie,

>Thanks for taking the time to source me out on my Github profile. As you may know, i'm quite an avid supporter of open source and general development, as you can see on my Github the various projects I have released and the various projects I have worked on, although not all.  You can find more of the work I do on my portfolio.

>I've done various different projects and worked with loads of different people, like the British Red Cross, RNLI, American Red Cross and ARK. Once I wrote an app for ARK for one of their charity events which would handle the pledges given by the guests at the event. It was a really expensive event, £10,000 a ticket I believe, I had to wear a suit and everything. I don't really like wearing suits because it reminds me of when I had to wear school uniform which I hated because it was boring and uncomfortable. The highlight of my day would be coming home from a school and stripping down. When my parents came home from work, they'd always tell me off for being nude in the house and sitting on the brand new leather sofa my dad worked overtime to pay for.

So all-in-all a successful response. Not only did I get my point across, but I also (hopefully) gave at least one person a good chuckle.

But things changed when, as soon as I got the last response, I also got another email. This time, from the original Michael.

Now a quick note, this is my personal blog. Secondly, there is absolutely no identifying pieces of information in any of the posts, I made sure of it. Thirdly, with a name like "Mike Adams", you really couldn't have a more generic name.

>Thanks for finally taking the time to email me regarding my personal blog. I was beginning to wonder if you would get back into contact with me, did Simon ever let you know what he thought? I'd love to hear about it.

>Anyway, regarding the post that was put up all those many months ago, i'm afraid I'm going to have to decline, unless of course you are THE Michael Adams, Number 4 ranking Chess grandmaster of the UK, in which case, i'd love your autograph. I've always been a big fan of the Chess game, I used to play it in an after school club with my former teacher, (ironically) Mr. Adams. You're not by any chance related? I was very bad at chess, i'd lose every game I played. I think its because I was too busy thinking of better things I could do with my time after school then sit in the sweaty library with all the other nerd kids. Then again, I think it could have been because of how uncomfortable I was sat in my school uniform after 6 hours of school and an hour of chess in a sweaty library.

This is a shame. Now how will I ever get a job in London with my skill-set without the help of an agency? Sad smiley face.
